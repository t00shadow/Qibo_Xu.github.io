**🔍 I’m a fourth-year postdoc at UCLA’s [Zhou Lab](https://zhoulab.org/), using deep learning to decode molecular structure.**

**📚 I hold a BSc in [Physics](https://english.phy.pku.edu.cn/), a PhD in [Meteorology](http://english.iap.cas.cn/), and have spent three years in postdoctoral research in [Structural Biology](https://cnsi.ucla.edu/).**

**🧠 My interests: discovering hidden patterns across scientific systems, and optimizing complex strategies.**
  - 🧩 I build interpretable models to reveal structure in proteins, weather, and markets—bridging physics, biology, and data.
  - ⚙️ I design efficiency: streamlining workflows, crafting investment logic, and engineering decision systems in Texas Hold’em.
