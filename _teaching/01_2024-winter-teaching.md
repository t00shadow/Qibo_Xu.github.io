**Project: Deep Learning-Enabled Approach for the Identification and Atomic Model Building of Large RNA-Protein Complexes from Cryogenic Electron Microscopy Maps**

- Mentored student teams through the **implementation and experimental phase** of their capstone projects, building on their Fall quarter proposals.  
- Supervised progress on this project, advising on:  
  - **Training and testing deep learning models** for distinguishing DNA, RNA, and protein densities in cryo-EM maps.  
  - **Graphical User Interface (GUI) design**, ensuring usability for non-expert researchers in structural biology.  
  - Integration of preliminary results into **journal-style manuscripts** (Introduction, Methods, Results, Figures).  
- Guided students in the **automated curation of cryo-EM datasets**, organizing the workflow into a manuscript that was prepared and published on [**bioRxiv**](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.09.09.675185).  
- Supported preparation of **[posters](/files/Final_poster_2024_winter.pdf)** and **[oral presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ljmwfj5BKin_IFQjOL7XL-tkaiSIHXBs?rtpof=true&usp=drive_fs)** for the Capstone Symposium, emphasizing clarity of AI-driven structural biology results to both scientific and industry audiences.
