**Project: Deep Learning-Enabled Approach for the Identification and Atomic Model Building of Large RNA-Protein Complexes from Cryogenic Electron Microscopy Maps**

**[Project proposal](/files/Project_2023-2024.pdf)**

- Mentored senior bioengineering students during the **proposal development phase** of their capstone projects.  
- Guided teams on **project scoping, background research, and NIH-style grant proposal writing**.  
- Advised students on constructing a **local structural database** (covering ribosomes, spliceosomes, polymerases, helicases, etc.), ensuring accurate alignment between cryo-EM maps and atomic models while removing redundancies.  
- Provided technical feedback on **team project planning** (Gantt charts, budgets, experimental design) and helped students improve their **scientific communication skills** through presentations and proposal drafts.
