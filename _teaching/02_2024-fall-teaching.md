**Project: Trace the Backbone of Protein and RNA with Known Key Atom Positions**

- Provide an **[undergraduate research project proposal](/files/Project_2024-2025.pdf)** for this course.
- Mentored senior bioengineering students during the **proposal development phase** of their capstone projects.  
- Guided teams on **project scoping, background research, and NIH-style grant proposal writing**.  
- Supervised students working on the project *“Trace the Backbone of Protein and RNA with Known Key Atom Positions”*, which focused on developing algorithms to reconstruct atomic backbones from cryo-EM maps.  
- Instructed students on **atomic model file formats (CIF/PDB)** and strategies for generating simplified backbone-only models.  
- Provided technical feedback on **team project planning** (Gantt charts, budgets, experimental design) and helped students improve their **scientific communication skills** through presentations and proposal drafts.
