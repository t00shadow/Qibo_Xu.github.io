**Project: Trace the Backbone of Protein and RNA with Known Key Atom Positions**

- Mentored student teams through the **implementation and algorithm development phase**, building on their Fall quarter proposals.  
- Supervised progress on backbone-tracing research, including:  
  - Learning and applying **TSP and VRP algorithms** to structural biology problems.  
  - Adapting the **OR-tools VRP solver** for backbone tracing from key atom positions.  
  - Testing algorithms with both experimental cryo-EM data and predicted atom positions.  
- Supported development of a **software tool with clear input/output design**, ensuring usability for structural biologists.  
- Advised on preparing **journal-style manuscripts, [posters](/files/Final_poster_2025_winter.pdf),** and **[oral presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ljmwfj5BKin_IFQjOL7XL-tkaiSIHXBs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112808743791861897029&rtpof=true&sd=true)** for the Capstone Symposium, helping students translate algorithmic results into **publishable-quality outputs**.
